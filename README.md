# meda

Meda is a general purpose programming language that is influenced by TypeScript,
Go, and Rust.

Everything that is in this repo is very much experimental. You have been
 warned :-)

## Design Ideas

1. Types are required. Why? Safety, debugging, and scalability.
2. Semis are required. Why? I don't want people to waste time thinking about
 whether they are required or not.
3. All programs need to have a main method. Why? Having a main method makes it 
easier to figure out where a program starts.
